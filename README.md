# Rainfall-Analysis-Using-Data-Visualization

## 🌧️ Project Overview
This project analyzes rainfall data and visualizes trends to identify patterns, anomalies, and insights. Using Python and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we make rainfall data more understandable and interpretable.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand historical rainfall data.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualize rainfall patterns over time and geography.
- Identify peak rainfall months, trends, and variations.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Format**: CSV/Excel  
- **Features**:  
  - Month/Year  
  - Region/State/City  
  - Rainfall (in mm)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Visualizations

- Line plots for yearly rainfall trends.
- Bar charts for monthly averages.
- Heatmaps for seasonal distribution.
- Area-wise comparison graphs.
